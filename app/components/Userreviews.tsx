      comment: `I rarely come across real talents who stand out like Raj.I had
          the pleasure of working with him for 2 years for contributing in
          my projects.Rajâ€™s ability to handle multiple projects was unlike
          any I have seen before and made dramatic increse in the
          productivity level in my projects.I always surprised with his
          excessive Java and FrontEnd particularly in React and
          NodeJS,GraphQL and more not jus one particular but everything were
          really great.No matter how big is the task is he can handle it
          very smoothly and get the job done.When ever I had a problem there
          has never been a time he has left me without a solution.He remains
          one of the smartest people I know and have worked with.So I will
          recommend him very strong for your projects.`,
